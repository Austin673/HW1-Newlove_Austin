            <b>Hello, my name is Austin Newlove and I'm a student here at Fanshawe in the Interactive Media and Design program. I'm not originally from London I actually moved here for school from a little town called Burford about forty-five minutes away from London. When I'm not in class or working on homework I'm usually online playing video games with my friends or drawing for fun. I also create models for a game called VRChat in my spare time and have become known as the "Guy Fieri" of VRChat due to my use of a random Guy Fieri model I use as my avatar. I love everything about computers from building them to playing on them and I hope I can learn more about them during my stay here at Fanshawe. A drawing example is below and model to the right.</b>
